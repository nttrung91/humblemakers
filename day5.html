      <p>(Quote: we will win this! It's our future - by Kenny)</p>

      <p>We not only learn together, but also we eat together, play pool together. Every time we get along, we know each other more. Cubi and James always share the same food. They can even give the same answer to my question in the same pace. When they answered "we love everything", I heard the voice that seems like coming from the same person! Although Kenny and Kevin are both professional photographers, they are interested in different subjects. Kevin likes to emphasize small objects and their unique characteristics. Kenny instead prefers to record lovely moments between couples. What's more important, we had our first group photo all together, and we even took one photo with Jame's style of presentation gesture! Cubi is so generous that he shares with us his account on resource websites!</p>

      <p>I really appreciate the AppJam Competition since it makes our group united. When I am in the Makers team, I discover more perspectives of myself. We smile as if everything is awesome.It is actually awesome that the destiny arrange us to meet each other!</p>
