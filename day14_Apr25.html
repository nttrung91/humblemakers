      <p>Our product did not win a grand prize. It may not satisfy the rubic of creativity and uniqueness. To be honest, we all felt sad for not winning at least the third price. We may not good rule followers, but we are passionate about our design. I believe that it will not be the last time we join the compettion as a team. Next time, we will do more research on the rubics in order to better demonstrate our skills.</p>

      <p>Because we dedicated so much to the competition, we fell behind in many classes. Therefore, Kevin will make up his one-week statistics classes. Kenny will study for his python class, which is the first class he skipped in UCI. Cubi, James, Kevin, Kenny all have to make up their INF148. Good luck, guys! I had to make up my one-week 6D classes, too.</p>

      <p>There is a proverb "every party has an ending." However, our party has not done yet! We are going to do summer research, learning new language, find another place to eat other than chopotle, play sports other than the pool, and join more competitions! I believe the best experience with the right team are bound to bring us confidence in interviews! Blogs and amazing photos will be contined.</p>
