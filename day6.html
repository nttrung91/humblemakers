      <p>Since we became a group in AppJam, we have been sticking together in the afternoon every day. Today, James was reading on his phone. Cubi was working and joking at the same time. Kevin was talking photos to relieve stress. Kenny and I were learning HTML. We went to eat Ramen after working. Cubi picked up the coupon on the floor, assuming that no one was watching him. Ramen were so delicious that we had to save YogurtLand for next time. Kenny and I learnt to pronounce “love” in the humble Makers’ vocabularies, which is “loave”! Also, we agreed that we only talked about technology and positive opinions about other people to prevent ego from growing.</p>

      <p>I didn't remember what happen to my every day before. Now, I remember every detail with the humble makers. My life was monotonous and serious before. Now, every day is filled with surprises and happiness. The memory I had with the humble makers are so treasurable that I want to markdown events everyday even with my limited writing skills.</p>
