      <p>Today saw the creation of our great design idea! We watched a YouTube video about an autistic child named Gage. Playing with an IPAD significantly improved his cognitive skills. This is a remarkable start! Also, when we tried to get the projector in the EVOKE lab to work, I realized that Kenny is so great with technological equipment. Our group members are so AWESOME! By the way, Kevin finally enrolled in our line group. I feel sorry that his phone will not be quiet anymore.</p>
