      <p>(Quote: It is so exciting to see our ideas becoming real - by Kubi)</p>

      <p>In order to implement our application, we learned HTML, CSS and JavaScrpit together. The best way to learn is by application. Since we understood what coding our application entailed, we couldn't wait to learn more and implement our application as soon as possible. Kevin and Cubi are the professors and I am the student.</p>

      <p>Cubi admitted he was joking before when he said "we will win." However, through all the learning process, he can see the path to win in his mind and foresee the approaching of victory. In fact, we didn't realize that it was a joke at first and believed that it was our future. Therefore, we were motivated to learn whatever it took to approach the end.</p>
