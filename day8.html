      <p>(Quote: Leadership is about opening a new door - by James)</p>

      <p>As our design idea gets more and more clear, we get more and more excited! I went to bed at 4 since all the thoughts kept flooding in my brain. In this morning, we were struggling about how to improve UI and everyone was stuck at that time. After we took a rest, Kubi suddenly camp up with a "delicious" solution and life became hopeful again! At that moment, I realized how beautiful is software engineering. It's the process of creating and exploring. We don't know the solution to the puzzle and whether we can find it. However, that's why it is so rewarding when we feel the perfect and unexpected solution!</p>
