      <span class="quote">(Quote of the day: We like to joke, but when we work, we are serious -- by Cubi)</span>

      <p>Today, we attended the three workshops offered on the 6th floor of DBH. We sincerely enjoyed all three topics and guest speakers. Gina's pizza was delightful too! Candice may or may not have eaten four slices :)</p>

      <p>Afterwards, we read portraits of autism as described by parents of autistic children. James summarized each one in two minutes! He is so good at taking notes and types so FAST. We were moved by descriptions of the beautiful moments when autistic children say their first words.</p>

      <p>After organizing our research, we decided to end the day at Veggie Grill. Partly because it's delicious. But also since Candice is undergoing a challenge with her friend to not eat meat for 20 days. Over a sweet and tangy thai "chikin" salad, onion rings, bbq steak sandwich, and quinoa salad, we reflected on our time together so far.</p>

      <p>We work efficiently not only because of our serious attitude but also because of the supportive environment Cubi creates. He says "No Problem" no matter what happens. After we work, we like to joke a lot. I heared an interesting comment before, "only smart people like to joke because they have time to think up jokes besides working." I just realize how true is it today!</p>

      <h2>Let's Git It</h2>

      <p>After the workshop, we went to 5th floor DBH to do research on Autism and discuss about collaboration tools. We decide to collaborate our codes through Git for its' powerful features. To make Git more fun, we named our repositories behind our favorite Chinese food such as Bokchoy and Pipatofu. Bokchoy contains the working code and Pipatofu contains the blog posts. Git is challenging but through our strong team bonding, we will be able to Git it =)</p>
