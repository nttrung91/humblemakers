      <span class="quote">(Quote of the day: I'm gonna miss the days when we stayed up late together - by Cubi)</span>

      <p>I can't believe that it was the last day already.Everyone did a great job as usual. James did not tell us that he was starving until we were done with work. Kenny were so "humble" and kept saying "NO." Kevin tried to finish the poster before the deadline even if his eyes were so tired. Cubi sacrified his time with his uncle from Vietnam and bought the expensive plane ticket in order to stay with us in our presentation. Even he asked us to go to bed early, he was the one who stayed up late to finish most of the coding. </p>

      <p>I still remembered the first day I met them, I knew that I was in the right group. At first, I believed this instuition comes from their humor. Now, I realize that they are my destiny because everyone contributes to the team wholeheartly but asking for little. </p>

      <p>We spent all our after-class time together. Everytime I finished my class, I walked fast and looked forward to meeting them, just like something important is waiting for me. Everytime I got tired and looked around, I saw them work hard for the competition and refilled my energy. Tomorrow will be our best day and it will pass so fast again. However, it is not goodbye. Although line may not active at 2am like right now, we will still have stickers competitions and get in touch. Although we are not going to stay at school until 1am like right now, we will still study together and eat our favorite Ramon and Chipotle:) Tomorrow is a brand start!</p>
